# This workflow will build and push a node.js application to an Azure Web App when a commit is pushed to your default branch.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure App Service web app.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-nodejs?pivots=platform-linux
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Download the Publish Profile for your Azure Web App. You can download this file from the Overview page of your Web App in the Azure Portal.
#    For more information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=app-service-scm-profile#generate-deployment-credentials
#
# 2. Create a secret in your repository named AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE_RELIEF360_BACKEND, paste the publish profile contents as the value of the secret.
#    For instructions on obtaining the publish profile: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions#configure-the-github-secret
#
# 3. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME.
#
# 4. Change the value for the NODE_VERSION.
